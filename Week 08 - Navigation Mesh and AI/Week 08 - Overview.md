**Note for Students**: This week is all about bringing intelligence to your game world. The AI you create can significantly impact the player's experience, so think about how you can make interactions interesting and challenging. Experiment with different AI behaviors and see how they can enhance the gameplay. Remember, good AI should not only be smart but also fun to interact with!

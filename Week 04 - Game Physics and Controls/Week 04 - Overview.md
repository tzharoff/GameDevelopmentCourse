### Week 4: Game Physics and Controls

**Objective**: Gain an understanding of Unity's physics engine and learn to implement realistic player controls and object interactions.

---

#### Monday: Introduction to Unity's Physics Engine
- **Morning Session**:
  - Overview of Unity's physics components (Rigidbody, Colliders).
  - Understanding the principles of game physics.
  - Applying physics to GameObjects.
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Experiment with adding Rigidbody and Colliders to objects and observe their behavior.

#### Tuesday: Implementing Basic Player Controls
- **Morning Session**:
  - Scripting player movement using physics (e.g., walking, jumping).
  - Handling player input for movement.
  - Fine-tuning movement controls for better feel.
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Create a simple player character and implement basic movement controls.

#### Wednesday: Advanced Movement and Physics Interactions
- **Morning Session**:
  - Advanced movement techniques (e.g., running, crouching).
  - Implementing force and impulse.
  - Creating interactive physics-based objects (e.g., pushable boxes, bouncing platforms).
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Enhance your player character with advanced movements and interact with physics-based objects.

#### Thursday: Collision Detection and Response
- **Morning Session**:
  - Understanding collision and trigger events in Unity.
  - Differentiating between OnCollisionEnter and OnTriggerEnter.
  - Scripting responses to collisions (e.g., taking damage, collecting items).
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Develop a scene with various collision-based interactions.

#### Friday: Review and Physics Mini-Project
- **Morning Session**:
  - Recap of the physics concepts covered during the week.
  - Q&A session to address any questions.
  - Introduction to the mini-project: Create a game level utilizing physics and controls learned.
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Design and implement a game level or scene that showcases the use of physics and player controls.
- **End of Day**:
  - Present your physics-based level or scene.
  - Feedback session with instructors and peers.

**Note for Students**: This week is all about making your game feel more realistic and interactive through physics. Experimentation is key, so don't hesitate to try out different physics concepts and see how they can enhance your game's experience. Remember, the way your game feels to play is just as important as how it looks!

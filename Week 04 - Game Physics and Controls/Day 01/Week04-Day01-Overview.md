# Week 4, Day 1: Introduction to Game Physics and Controls

## Overview

Welcome to the first day of Week 4 in our Unity Game Development course. This week, we're focusing on Game Physics and Controls — essential elements that bring dynamics and realism to your games. Today, we'll start by exploring Unity's physics engine and how to implement basic player controls.

## Schedule

### Morning Session

#### Overview of Unity's Physics Engine
- **Time**: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
- **Activities**:
  - Introduction to the concepts of game physics.
  - Exploring Unity's physics components like Rigidbody and Colliders.
  - Understanding how physics is used to create realistic movements and interactions.

#### Implementing Basic Player Controls
- **Time**: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- **Activities**:
  - Scripting basic player controls for movement (walking, jumping).
  - Handling player input through keyboard and mouse.
  - Best practices for creating responsive and intuitive controls.

#### Break
- **Time**: 11:00 AM - 11:15 AM

#### Practical Exercise: Player Movement
- **Time**: 11:15 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Activities**:
  - Hands-on exercise to implement player movement in a sample game scene.
  - Testing and fine-tuning movement parameters for smooth control.

### Afternoon Session

#### Solo Project Work
- **Time**: 1:00 PM - 4:30 PM
- **Objective**: Develop a basic gameplay scene with player movement.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a new scene or modify an existing one to incorporate player movement.
  - Implement different types of movements and experiment with physics properties.
  - Test and refine the controls to ensure a good player experience.

#### Wrap-Up and Reflection
- **Time**: 4:30 PM - 5:00 PM
- **Activities**:
  - Review of the day's work and discussion on the challenges faced.
  - Sharing session: Present your player movement implementation and gather feedback.
  - Introduction to tomorrow's topic: Advanced Movement and Physics Interactions.

## Preparation

- Familiarize yourself with the Unity Editor, specifically the Rigidbody and Collider components.
- Think about the type of movement mechanics you want to implement in your game scene.

## Note for Students

Understanding and implementing game physics and controls is a critical step in bringing your game to life. Focus on how your character or objects move and interact within the game world. Experimentation is key — try different settings and see how they affect the gameplay. Remember, well-implemented physics and controls greatly enhance the player's experience.

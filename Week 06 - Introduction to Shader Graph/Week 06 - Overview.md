#### Monday: Understanding Shaders and Shader Graph
- **Morning Session**:
  - Introduction to shaders and their role in game graphics.
  - Overview of Shader Graph in Unity.
  - Setting up your first Shader Graph project.
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Explore Shader Graph and create a basic shader (e.g., changing colors).

#### Tuesday: Creating Simple Shaders
- **Morning Session**:
  - Working with nodes in Shader Graph.
  - Creating simple shaders (e.g., texture mapping, color blending).
  - Applying shaders to game objects.
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Develop and apply simple shaders to objects in a scene.

#### Wednesday: Shader Properties and Interaction
- **Morning Session**:
  - Understanding and utilizing shader properties.
  - Creating interactive shaders (e.g., shaders that change with player interaction or game events).
  - Debugging and optimizing shaders.
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Create shaders with interactive properties (e.g., changing appearance on mouse hover).

#### Thursday: Advanced Shader Techniques
- **Morning Session**:
  - Advanced Shader Graph techniques (e.g., creating transparency, reflections).
  - Implementing lighting in shaders.
  - Exploring creative shader effects.
- **Solo Project Work**:

#### Friday: Review and Shader Mini-Project
- **Morning Session**:
  - Recap of the week's learning on Shader Graph.
  - Q&A session to resolve any uncertainties.
  - Introduction to the mini-project: Crafting a unique shader.
- **Solo Project Work**:
  - Design and develop a unique shader for a specific game element or scene.
- **End of Day**:
  - Present your shader in action within a scene.
  - Feedback and discussion session with instructors and peers.

**Note for Students**: This week, you'll get to explore the artistic side of game development through shaders. Shaders can dramatically change the look and feel of your game, so feel free to experiment and be creative. Don't worry if you find it challenging at first; shader development is a skill that grows with practice and experimentation.

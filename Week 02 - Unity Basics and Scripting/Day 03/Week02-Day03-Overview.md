# Week 2, Day 3: Game Logic and Functions

## Overview

Day 3 of Week 2 in our Unity Game Development course is all about diving deeper into the scripting aspects of Unity, with a focus on game logic and functions. Today, you will learn how to structure your scripts more effectively and implement fundamental game mechanics using C#.

## Schedule

### Morning Session

#### Delving into Game Logic: Conditionals and Loops
- **Time**: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
- **Activities**:
  - Introduction to conditional statements (`if`, `else`) and their role in game decision-making.
  - Understanding loops (`for`, `while`) and their use in creating repetitive behaviors and automated tasks.
  - Practical examples showing how these concepts drive game actions and events.

#### Creating Functions for Reusable Code
- **Time**: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- **Activities**:
  - Discussing the importance of functions in organizing and reusing code.
  - Writing custom functions to perform specific tasks in games.
  - Best practices for naming and structuring functions for clarity and efficiency.

#### Break
- **Time**: 11:00 AM - 11:15 AM

#### Understanding Unity's Update Methods
- **Time**: 11:15 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Activities**:
  - Exploring Unity's lifecycle methods like `Update()`, `FixedUpdate()`, and `LateUpdate()`.
  - Practical use cases for each method in controlling game behavior and animations.
  - Hands-on exercise to implement these methods in a script.

### Afternoon Session

#### Solo Project Work
- **Time**: 1:00 PM - 4:30 PM
- **Objective**: Develop scripts utilizing conditionals, loops, and functions to create basic game mechanics.
- **Tasks**:
  - Apply conditional statements and loops to control game events (e.g., triggering animations, managing game states).
  - Create and utilize functions to streamline your code and manage game actions efficiently.
  - Experiment with `Update()` methods to control continuous aspects of your game (e.g., player movement, AI behavior).

#### Wrap-Up and Reflection
- **Time**: 4:30 PM - 5:00 PM
- **Activities**:
  - Recap of the day’s learning and achievements.
  - Share your progress and experiences with implementing game logic.
  - Preview of tomorrow's topic: Interacting with GameObjects and Components.

## Preparation

- Review the C# scripting basics covered in the previous days, focusing on syntax and basic constructs.
- Prepare ideas or scenarios where you might need to use conditionals, loops, and functions in a game setting.

## Note for Students

Understanding game logic and how to structure it using functions is key to developing engaging and dynamic games. Today’s focus will be on how to translate your game ideas into practical scripts that control the gameplay. Remember, clean and efficient coding practices will make your development process smoother and more enjoyable!

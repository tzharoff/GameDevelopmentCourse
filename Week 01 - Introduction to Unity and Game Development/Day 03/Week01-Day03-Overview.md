# Week 1, Day 3: Basic Object Manipulation and Scene Composition

## Overview

Welcome to Day 3 of our Unity Game Development course. Building on what we've learned so far, today we'll focus on creating and manipulating basic 3D objects. We'll also dive into scene composition and camera positioning, essential skills for setting up your game environments.

## Schedule

  - Understanding the properties and transformations of these objects (scale, rotation, position).

#### Transforming Objects and Scene Composition
- **Time**: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- **Activities**:
  - In-depth discussion on transforming objects (moving, rotating, scaling).
  - Basics of composing a visually appealing scene.

  - Practical exercise: Create a small environment using basic 3D objects.
  - Experiment with arranging objects and setting up the camera for the best view.

### Afternoon Session

#### Solo Project Work
- **Time**: 1:00 PM - 4:30 PM
- **Objective**: Apply the morning's lessons in a practical project.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design and build a simple scene, such as a room or a small outdoor area.
  - Focus on the placement and manipulation of objects to create a coherent environment.
  - Adjust the camera to showcase your scene from the best perspective.

#### Wrap-Up and Review
- **Time**: 4:30 PM - 5:00 PM
- **Activities**:
  - Recap of the day's lessons.
  - Sharing session: Present your scene to the class and discuss your design choices.
  - Introduction to tomorrowâ€™s topics: materials and textures.

## Preparation

- Review the notes from the previous days, especially on GameObjects and the Unity interface.
- Think about a simple scene you would like to create, such as a room with furniture or a small garden.

## Note for Students

Today's focus on object manipulation and scene composition is vital for bringing your game environments to life. Pay attention to the details of your scene and think about how each element contributes to the overall feel and aesthetics. Remember, great game environments are immersive and well-composed!

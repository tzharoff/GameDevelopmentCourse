## Assignment: Exploring Unity Through Hands-On Experience

### Overview

This afternoon, you'll embark on a hands-on journey into the world of Unity. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the Unity Editor by setting up your first solo project and creating a simple scene. This assignment is designed to consolidate your understanding of the Unity interface and key functionalities discussed in this morning's session.

### Objectives

- Gain practical experience with the Unity Editor.
- Understand the process of setting up a new Unity project.
- Learn basic object manipulation techniques within the Unity environment.

### Tasks

#### 1. Set Up Your First Solo Project
- **Instructions**:
  - Open Unity Hub and click on the 'New Project' button.
  - Choose a template that best fits a simple game scene (e.g., 3D Core).
  - Name your project something memorable, like "MyFirstUnityProject".
  - Once created, familiarize yourself with the project directory and layout.

#### 2. Create a Simple Scene with Basic Objects
- **Instructions**:
  - Navigate to the Hierarchy panel and use the right-click context menu to create basic geometric shapes (e.g., Cube, Sphere) which will serve as your primary objects.
  - Arrange these objects to form a simple scene. This could be anything from a basic landscape to an abstract composition.
  - Use the Scene view to adjust the camera angle for the best view of your creation.

#### 3. Experiment with Object Manipulation
- **Instructions**:
  - Select each object in turn and experiment with the Transform tool to move, rotate, and scale your objects.
  - Try to create a visually pleasing arrangement. Consider size relationships, balance, and composition.
  - Use the Inspector panel to further adjust the properties of each object, such as their color (via the Material component).

### Submission Details

- **Screenshot**: Take a screenshot of your scene from the Game view, ensuring your objects are clearly visible.
- **Reflection**: Write a brief reflection (200-300 words) on your experience. Include what you learned about the Unity interface, any challenges you faced during object manipulation, and how you overcame them.

### Submission Deadline

Please upload your screenshot and reflection to the LMS assignment portal by end of day today.

### Grading Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following:
- Successful creation and setup of a new Unity project.
- Demonstrated ability to create and manipulate basic objects within a scene.
- Thoughtfulness and insights shared in your reflection piece.

### Submission Guidelines

- Please submit your Unity project file along with the reflection document to the LMS by the end of the day.
- Ensure your files are correctly named and include your name or student ID for easy identification.

### Additional Notes

Remember, this exercise is about exploration and familiarization. There are no right or wrong outcomes here, only valuable hands-on experience. Don't hesitate to experiment and push your creativity. Good luck!

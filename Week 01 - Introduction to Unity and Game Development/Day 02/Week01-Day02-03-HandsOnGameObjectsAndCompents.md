## Hands-On Session with GameObjects and Components

### Overview

This hands-on session is designed to solidify your understanding of Unity's core concepts — GameObjects and Components — through direct application. By actively engaging in creating and modifying GameObjects, and experimenting with various Components, you'll gain practical experience that is essential for developing games in Unity. This module encourages exploration and experimentation, allowing you to see firsthand how GameObjects and Components interact to bring game ideas to life.

### Activities

#### Practical Exercise: Creating and Modifying GameObjects
- **Objective**: Learn how to create GameObjects within Unity and modify their properties to suit the needs of your game scene.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Start by creating basic GameObjects (such as Cubes, Spheres, and Planes) within a new Unity scene.
  2. Modify the properties of these GameObjects, including position, rotation, and scale, to understand how they can be manipulated within the scene.
  3. Explore the use of parent-child relationships between GameObjects to create more complex structures or hierarchies within your game.

#### Experimenting with Adding and Configuring Various Components
- **Objective**: Gain familiarity with Unity's Component system, understanding how Components can add functionality and behavior to GameObjects.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Select a GameObject in your scene and experiment by adding different Components through the Inspector panel. Focus on Components such as `Rigidbody` for physics behaviors, `Colliders` for physical boundaries, and `MeshRenderers` for visual appearances.
  2. Configure the settings of each Component to see how they affect the GameObject's behavior. For example, adjust the mass and drag of a `Rigidbody` to see how it influences movement and interaction with other objects.
  3. Attempt to create a simple interactive element in your scene using Components. This could be a door that opens when approached or an object that changes color when clicked.

### Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, you will:
- Understand how to create and manipulate GameObjects within Unity.
- Have a foundational knowledge of Unity's Component system and how different Components can be used to add functionality to GameObjects.
- Experience firsthand the process of experimenting with Components to achieve desired behaviors in a game scene.

### Assignment
- **Create an Interactive Object**: Use what you've learned to create an object in Unity that responds to player input in some way (e.g., a ball that bounces when clicked).
- **Documentation**: Write a short document (200-300 words) describing the object you created, the Components you used, and how you configured them to achieve the interaction.
- **Submission**: Upload your Unity project file along with the documentation to the LMS.

This hands-on session is a crucial step towards becoming proficient in Unity game development. By experimenting with GameObjects and Components, you're not just following instructions; you're learning how to think like a game developer and solve problems creatively.
